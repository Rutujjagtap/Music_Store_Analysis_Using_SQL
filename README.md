## Music Store Analysis

  This project focuses on analysing a music store dataset using SQL queries, aimed at exploring various aspects of the business, from customer spending behaviour to popular music genres across different countries. 
The project is divided into three question sets ranging from easy to advanced difficulty levels. The easy set tackles basic inquiries such as identifying the senior-most employee and determining countries with the highest invoice counts. The moderate set delves into more complex queries, including identifying top rock music listeners and inviting prolific rock bands to events. Finally, the advanced set explores customer spending patterns on artists and determining the most popular music genres by country.   
  With a comprehensive set of SQL queries, this project provides insights valuable for business decision-making in the music industry.
